Customer Churn Prediction Using Random Forest Classifier

This project focuses on predicting customer churn for telecom companies using machine learning techniques. A Random Forest Classifier model is developed to predict whether a customer is likely to churn, based on historical data. The project involves data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model training and optimization, and deployment of an interactive web application for real-time predictions.

Project Overview

Churn prediction is a critical task for telecom companies looking to reduce customer attrition and enhance retention strategies. By leveraging machine learning, this project aims to develop a robust Random Forest Classifier model to predict churn, while also providing an interactive solution for real-time decision-making.

Key Features
	•	Data Preprocessing & EDA: Utilized Pandas, NumPy, and Scikit-learn for effective data preprocessing and performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).
	•	Random Forest Classifier: Developed and trained a Random Forest Classifier to predict customer churn. Optimized model performance with hyperparameter tuning and validated using cross-validation techniques.
	•	Model Evaluation: Evaluated model performance using key metrics like precision, recall, and F1-score to ensure balanced, reliable predictions for churn forecasting.
	•	Interactive Streamlit Web App: Developed and deployed a real-time, interactive Streamlit web application to visualize churn predictions and provide actionable insights for telecom companies. Hosted on Streamlit Cloud for easy access and use by business stakeholders.
